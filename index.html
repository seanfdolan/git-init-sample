HTML
The head element contains information about the webpage.
The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
Declarations are not case sensative but elements are case sensative.
HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.
Elements nested inside other elements are called "child elements." Elements that hold children are called "parent elements."
Use semantic HTML elements when possible to make HTML easier to read.
CSS
A margin indicates how much space we want arount the outside of an element.
A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.
Increasing padding will make the entire element bigger.
Asterisk * is a special symbol that declares ALL elements on the page will have the style properties.
Three Ways to Style a Webpage
Inline CSS
Style elements directly into HTML file.
Useful for quick and permanent changes.
Less flexible than external/internal style sheets.
Each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.
Internal Style Sheet
Embed the entire stylesheet into HTML file using style elements in the head element.
External Style Sheet
Most common; allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in separate file.
Design changes are easier.
Link the file using the link element placed in the HTML head.
Separation of concerns; separating code into different files bases on use. Each section of code should have it's own responsibility
You can combine selectors into CSS rule with a comma to not repat yourself.
DRY = Do Not Repeat Yourself; reduce overall size and complexity of code when possible.
Class attribute; add style to certain elements but not all elements. Can be asigned to the element in the HTML (ex. card).
Git
Verserion control system used to save and track versions of code.
Every version is assigned a unique identifer called SHA (hash).
git status: checks what branch we are currently on
git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it
git checkout main: switch to main
git pull origin main: pull down main branch
Workflow for Content Updates
Create a branch.
Open a pull request.
Merge and deploy.
JavaScript
Allows users interact with websites.
Browser readss code in the order it appears in the file.
Case sensative.
A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.
Control flo w is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.
/*Comments*/ //This is a comment.

Conditionals are if/else statements.
Functions are set of instructions that are packaged and can be reused. Must call functions by name to execute it.
Events listen for activity and run code in response. (ex. click event)
Undefined (absence of value; identifer); Null (absence of an object (keyword)

Arrays are single variables that are used to hold a group of data and can hold different types of data.
Arrays are zero indexed and sequential.
For loops allow single code block to be execute over and over. Must use 'if' statement to interrupt the control flow.
For loops contain (1) starting point, (2) condition, and (3) final statement.
